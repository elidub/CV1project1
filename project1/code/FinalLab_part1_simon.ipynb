    "# **General Guideline**\n",
    "1. Aim:\n",
    "    - Able to understand the basic Image Classification/Recognition pipeline using traditional Bag of Words method.\n",
    "    - Able to use to python packages for image classification: *matplotlib, cv2, sklearn etc.*\n",
    "2. Prerequisite:\n",
    "    - Familiar with python and relevant packages.\n",
    "    - Know the basics of feature descriptors(SIFT, HoG) and machine learning tools (K-means, SVM and etc.). \n",
    "3. Guidelines:\n",
    "    Students should work on the assignments in a group of **three person** for two weeks. Some minor additions and changes  might happen with approval from the Senior TA. Students will be informed for these changes via Canvas. Any questions regarding the assignment content can be discussed on Piazza. Students are expected to do this assignment in Python and Pytorch, however students are free to choose other tools (like Tensorflow). Your source code and report must be handed in together in a zip file (*ID1_ID2_ID3.zip*) before the deadline. Make sure your report follows these guidelines:\n",
    "    - *The maximum number of pages is 10 (single-column, including tables and figures). Please express your thoughts concisely.*\n",
    "    - *Follow the given script and answer all given questions (in green boxes). Briefly describe what you implemented. Blue boxes are there to give you hints to answer questions.*\n",
    "    - *Analyze your results and discuss them, e.g. why algorithm A works better than algorithm B on a certain problem.*\n",
    "    - *Tables and figures must be accompanied by a brief description. Do not forget to add a number, a title, and if applicable name and unit of variables in a table, name and unit of axes and legends in a figure.*\n",
    "4. **Late submissions** are not allowed. Assignments that are submitted after the strict deadline will not be graded. In case of submission conflicts, TAs' system clock is taken as reference. We strongly recommend submitting well in advance, to avoid last minute system failure issues.\n",
    "5. **Plagiarism note**: \n",
    "Keep in mind that plagiarism (submitted materials which are not your work) is a serious crime and any misconduct shall be punished with the university regulations.\n",

    "This tutorial aims to make you familiar with the programming environment that will be used throughout the course. If you have experience with PyTorch or other frameworks (TensorFlow, MXNet *etc.*), you can skip the tutorial exercises; otherwise, we suggest that you complete them all, as they are helpful for getting hands-on experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anaconda Environment** We recommend installing \\textit{anaconda} for configuring \\textit{python} package dependencies, whereas it's also fine to use other environment managers as you like. The installation of anaconda can be found in [anaconda link](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).\n",

    "# **1. Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the assignment is to implement a system for image classification. In other words, this system should tell if there is an object of given class in an image. You will perform 5-class ({1: *airplanes*, 2: *birds*, 3: *ships*, 4: *horses*, 5: *cars*}) image classification based on bag-of-words approach ([reference](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~az/icvss08_az_bow.pdf)) using SIFT features, respectively. [STL-10 dataset](https://cs.stanford.edu/~acoates/stl10/) will be used for the task. For each class, test sub-directories contain 800 images, and training sub-directories contain 500 images. Images are represented as (RGB) 96x96 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the [dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~acoates/stl10/stl10_binary.tar.gz). There are five files: *test_X.bin*, *test_y.bin*, *train_X.bin*,*train_y.bin* and *unlabeled_X.bin*. For the project, you will just use the train and test partitions. Download the dataset and make yourself familiar with it by figuring out which images and labels you need for the aforementioned 5 classes. Note that you do not need *fold_indices* variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:**\n",
    "In a real scenario, the public data you use often deviates from your task. You need to figure it out and re-arrange the labels as required using *stl10\\_input.py* as a reference. "

Nonetheless, you can also use less images, say 100 from each class (exclusive from the previous subset) if your computational resources are limited.

Take images from the training set of the related class (should be the ones which you did not use for dictionary calculation). Represent them with histograms of visual words as discussed in the previous section. Use at least 50 training images per class or more, but remember to debug your code first! If you use the default setting, you should have 50 histograms of size 500. These will be your positive examples. Then, you will obtain histograms of visual words for images from other classes, again about 50 images per class, as negative examples. Therefore, you will have 200 negative examples. Now, you are ready to train a classifier. You should repeat it for each class. To classify a new image, you should calculate its visual words histogram as described in Section 2.4 and use the trained SVM classifier to assign it to the most probable object class. (Note that for proper SVM scores you need to use cross-validation to get a proper estimate of the SVM parameters. In this assignment, you do not have to experiment with this cross-validation step)."
